\chapter{Matlab procedure}
\label{appendix:Matlab_procedure}
A Matlab script is used to calculate the participation ratio of the lossy layers using the previously exported files from CST. The script will ask for the location of the files containing the data. To calculate the total energy in the system the script will ask for the capacitance and the voltage over the inductor. After the correct values are submitted the script will calculate and save the ratio.
