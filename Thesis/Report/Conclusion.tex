\chapter{Conclusion}
The largest reduction in participation ratios was achieved by elimination of the 'fingers' entirely. Further reduction can be achieved by increasing the separation of the pads. Both adjustments to the qubit design decrease the capacitance of the system. To compensate, the overall size of the capacitor pads can be increased.

In future qubit design, the capacitor pads should have a shape such that the electric field is spread out equally across as large an area as possible. The biggest constraint is the overall size of the resulting qubit system. With this in mind, the results in this research show that the rounding of corners is a promising adjustment to the qubit design.
